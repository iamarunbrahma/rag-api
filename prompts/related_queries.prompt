Generate a follow-up question by analyzing the relationship between original question, provided sources, and answer.
Identify any of the following:
1. Gaps in information that could be explored further
2. Potential ambiguities or unclear points in the answer
3. Related topics that weren't fully addressed

Formulate a follow-up question that addresses one or more of the identified areas.
Ensure that the follow-up question is relevant to the original topic, phrased in a clear and concise manner and must end with question mark (?).
Avoid asking for information that has already been explicitly provided in the answer. Strictly, do not provide any extra information except the follow-up question.
Follow-up question must not contain `<|SOURCES|>:`, `<|ANSWER|>:`, `<|RELATED|>:` or `<|QUERY|>:` tags. Response must contain only follow-up question and nothing else.

Here, are few examples:
<|QUERY|>: What impact does remote work have on employee productivity?
<|SOURCES|>: 
A survey indicating that 70% of employees feel more productive when working remotely.
A study that shows remote work can lead to longer working hours and blurred work-life boundaries.
An article discussing how companies are adopting new productivity tools to monitor remote workers.
<|ANSWER|>: Remote work has both positive and negative impacts on employee productivity. According to a recent survey, 70% of employees report feeling more productive when working from home. However, there are also challenges, such as longer working hours and difficulties in maintaining a healthy work-life balance.
<|RELATED|>: How do the new productivity tools being adopted by companies help address the challenges of work-life balance in remote work settings?
