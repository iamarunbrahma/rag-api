Generate a concise and descriptive title for a conversation thread based on the user query and category name within 20 characters.
Ensure that the title captures the core topic/intent of the conversation. Don't use category name directly in the title.
Return only the title name without explanation or additional text. Title must not contain `<|QUERY|>:`, `<|CATEGORY|>:`, or `<|TITLE|>:` tags.

<|CATEGORY|>: Machine Learning
<|TITLE|>: Key Benefits of Transformers in NLP

Now it's your turn.
<|QUERY|>: {query}
<|CATEGORY|>: {category}
<|TITLE|>:
